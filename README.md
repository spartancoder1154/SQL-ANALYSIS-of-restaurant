# SQL-ANALYSIS-of-restaurant

This SQL script contains a series of queries designed to explore and analyze a restaurant database table called `nomnom`. It begins by retrieving all data to understand the table structure, then identifies unique neighborhoods and cuisine types. The script helps filter restaurants based on various preferencesâ€”such as finding Chinese takeout options, highly-rated spots, Italian fine dining, and restaurants located in specific neighborhoods like Midtown or Chinatown. It also includes practical searches, such as finding restaurants with pending health grades or names containing specific keywords. Additional queries create a Top 10 ranking based on reviews and use a `CASE` statement to categorize restaurants into custom rating tiers like "Extraordinary" and "Poor." This set of queries is ideal for practice with filtering, sorting, and conditional logic in SQL.
